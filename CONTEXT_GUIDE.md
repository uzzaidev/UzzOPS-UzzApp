# Context Guide (Current)

This file is a quick pointer.  
For full, up-to-date context use:

1. `docs/AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT_MASTER.md`
2. `docs/RESTART_CHECKLIST.md`
3. `README.md`
4. `CODEBASE_MAP.md`
5. `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
6. `AI_CONTEXT.md`

## Why this exists

The old context guide became outdated and caused conflicting guidance.  
This file now intentionally stays short and forwards to the authoritative docs.

## Rule

If behavior/security/API changes, update:
- `docs/AI_PROJECT_CONTEXT_MASTER.md`
- `docs/README_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- and the relevant technical source file (`CODEBASE_MAP.md`, `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`, `AI_CONTEXT.md`, or `README.md`)
